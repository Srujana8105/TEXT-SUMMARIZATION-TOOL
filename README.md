# Text Summarization Tool using NLP

## Project Overview
This project implements a Text Summarization Tool using Natural Language Processing (NLP) techniques in Python. The tool generates concise summaries from lengthy text by identifying and selecting the most important sentences.

The approach used in this project is **extractive summarization**, where key sentences are chosen from the original text based on their relevance.

---

## Objective
- To process large textual input
- To apply NLP techniques for understanding text
- To generate meaningful and concise summaries automatically

---

## NLP Techniques Used
The following NLP concepts are used in this project:

- Sentence Tokenization
- Word Tokenization
- Stopword Removal
- Word Frequency Analysis
- Sentence Scoring
- Extractive Summarization

---

## Tools and Libraries
- Python
- NLTK (Natural Language Toolkit)

---

## How the System Works
1. The input text is divided into sentences.
2. Words are tokenized and converted to lowercase.
3. Stopwords and unnecessary characters are removed.
4. Word frequency is calculated.
5. Each sentence is scored based on important words.
6. Top-scoring sentences are selected to form the summary.

## How to Run the Project

### Install Dependencies
```bash
pip install nltk
Download Required NLTK Resources
import nltk
nltk.download('punkt')
nltk.download('punkt_tab')
nltk.download('stopwords')
